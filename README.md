# Traceroute_Analyzer
# This project provides an advanced **Traceroute Analyzer** that captures and compares traceroute data to diagnose network path changes, identify new hops, and monitor connectivity issues over time. The tool also generates a graphical visualization of the traceroute path for better analysis and debugging.
